# OPIM_3223_Final_Project

Chris Scene:
In this scene I am showing my Junior year of college. During my junior year I had my car on campus and as a result, received a parking ticket or two. That year I also took biology, and we had a lab where we went to the greenhouses on campus by the Math/Science Building. This scene features the player running around the greenhouses collecting the money needed to pay for their parking ticket. The goal is to collect $100. There is money scattered around the greenhouse that will go towards the player's funds when run into. Move around using the WASD keys and move the camera with the mouse. You can also press spacebar to jump. When you begin the scene a ding indicates you can move and the background music begins to play. There is money on top of cacti, which you will need to jump over. If you touch the cacti, you will take damage. It is currently set up so that you can take 5 hits until you fail the level. From there you will be transported back to the main menu. If you collect $100 you will move to the next scene.
